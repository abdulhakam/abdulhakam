- 👋 Hi, I’m @abdulhakam
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, react, flutter, mechanical engines, mechanical chronographs, anything that seems interesting, etc...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, and in near future I would try to learn full stack most probably MERN (maybe something else if that seemed more interesting).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small react projects that are useful for small businesses like retail.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email zehas.11@gmail.com
